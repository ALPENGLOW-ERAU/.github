This is a placeholder organization for the ALPENGLOW Lab at ERAU.
Per IT suggestions, this enterprise organization prefers to hold repos for classes for instance, and research codes are not recommended. 

The reason is that GitHub doesn't provide a way to directly transfer an enterprise organization to a personal organization. 
Therefore, if for any reason I need to leave the GitHub organization, all the repositories have to be transferred one by one.

For this reason, I renamed this enterprise organization to `ALPENGLOW-ERAU` and moved everything to the new `ALPENGLOW-Lab` at https://github.com/ALPENGLOW-Lab
